<h1>The Sky Blue Sage</h1>

<h4>Kin: The people of Manwe</h4>
<p>Manwe is the Lord of the Winds and the King of the Valar. His followers are often seen as lofty and distant, like the skies themselves.</p>
<p>The color sky blue represents the vastness of the heavens and the freedom of the winds. As a follower of Manwe, you embody the power of the air and the skies.</p>
<p>You are a master of weather control and aerial magics.</p>
<p>Inherent strengths:
    <ul>
        <li>You can control weather patterns and summon storms or clear skies at will.</li>
        <li>Your affinity with birds allows you to communicate with them and see through their eyes.</li>
        <li>You are adept at wind-based magic, able to fly or levitate objects effortlessly.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    Inherent weaknesses:
    <ul>
        <li>Enclosed spaces or areas devoid of air currents limit your powers.</li>
        <li>Your lofty perspective can sometimes make you seem detached or aloof.</li>
        <li>Direct confrontation is not your forte; you prefer to work at a distance.</li>
    </ul>
