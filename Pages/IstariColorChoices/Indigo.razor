<h1>The Indigo Inferno</h1>

<h4>Kin: The people of Vaire</h4>
<h4>Mission: There is a gnawing creature of Melkor that is devouring the threads Vaire is weaving. You must find this creature and kill it.</h4>
<p>Vaire is the weaver of the tapestry that is time. All history is woven on her loom and all events can be found in the warp and woof.</p>
<p>Thus, it's no surprise really that she is married to Mandos, the god of death and the doomsayer of the Valar.</p>
<p>You are one of her weavers, gifted with a unique source of magic.</p>
<p>Inherent strengths:
    <ul>
        <li>You do not use willpower for magic. Instead, you manipulate the threads of time, causing things to happen or fail to happen.</li>
        <li>You cannot run out of magical ability, although there are caveats.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    Inherent weaknesses:
    <ul>
        <li>Anything unpredictable or chaotic, such as direct corruption, causes your magic to be less potent.</li>
        <li>Your magic can be manipulated by creatures of Melkor with the right powers.</li>
        <li>Every death is like a blow to your face.</li>
    </ul>
