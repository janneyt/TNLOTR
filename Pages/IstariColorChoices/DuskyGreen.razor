<h1>The Green God(dess)</h1>

<h4>Kin: The people of Orome</h4>
<h4>Mission: There is a rot spreading through the animals of the world. Whatever it touches, it kills in a hideous and painful way. Find its cause, and stop it.</h4>
<p>Orome has never abandoned Middle Earth and was the first Valar to find the Elves after they awoke. He is a great hunter, and wherever he travels all creatures of Morgoth flee.</p>
<p>You are a lesser spirit of his people. You can track anything, hunt anything, and given enough time and cleverness, kill anything.</p>
<p>Inherent strengths:
    <ul>
        <li>You are particularly adept with ranged weapons, using willpower to enhance accuracy and power.</li>
        <li>You have a lot of endurance and can travel farther and faster than anyone else.</li>
        <li>Once you have successfully begun tracking a creature, you never lose the track.</li>
        <li>You cause creatures of Morgoth to take fright without expending willpower.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    Inherent weaknesses:
    <ul>
        <li>Artificial creatures go out of their way to attack you.</li>
        <li>Shapeshifters particularly hate you.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
