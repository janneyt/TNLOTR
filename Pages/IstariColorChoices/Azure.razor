<h1>The Azure Ascendent</h1>
<h3>Kin: The people of Ulmo</h3>
<h3>Mission: There is a slowly growing patch of barren land where there used to be a lake. Find out why and see if you can stop it from spreading.</h3>
<p>The people of Ulmo are like Ulmo, aloof and ever present at the same time.</p>
<p>The ocean, Ulmo's domain, is mysterious but the source of life. You can be as unpredictable as the waves, or as stable as the deepest depths.</p>
<p>Ulmo is second only to Melkor and Manwe in power. However, he is the most involved in Middle Earth. For this reason, the Elves say that all rivers carry news to Ulmo.</p>
<p>This makes you a natural intelligence gathering spirit.</p>
